# React Resume

This is a resume made in React that can be exported as a PDF for job applications. I created this because I was tired of resume software that was difficult to format the way I wanted. As a Front End developer, I'm used to designing every little part of a web app using React, and I wanted a way to make a resume that is precise and flexible like a website built in React. So I created this!
